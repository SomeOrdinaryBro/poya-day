# poya-calendar
Interactive, responsive holiday calendar supporting Sri Lanka, the US, Australia, Canada and the UK.

## Running Locally

Just open `index.html` in a modern browser. A small ES module setup is used, so a local server is recommended:

```bash
npx serve -s .
```

## Data Sources

- Sri Lankan holidays from [Dilshan-H/srilanka-holidays](https://github.com/Dilshan-H/srilanka-holidays)
- Public holidays for the US and Australia via [Nager.Date](https://date.nager.at)
- Local JSON files for Canada and the UK included in the `assets` folder
